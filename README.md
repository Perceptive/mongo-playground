# Mongo Playground

I haven't liked any of the Mongo tools out there and using mongo from the CLI
is unwieldy, especially for complicated aggregations.  Mongo Playground is
themed from the GraphQL Playground, which was based upon GraphiQL.

## Features

* Supports queries using latest MongoDB Driver 3.1
* Connects to any MongoDB server using `mongodb` or `mongodb+srv` URLs
* Drop down lists all available methods
* Auto-populates list of collections to query
* Syntax highlighting and pretty printing of response data, including errors
* Helpful auto-formatting in textarea
* Nice interface üëç

## Using

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Perceptive/mongo-playground.git
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
