# Mongo Playground

I haven't liked any of the Mongo tools out there and using mongo from the CLI
is unwieldy, especially for complicated aggregations.  Mongo Playground is
themed from the GraphQL Playground, which was based upon GraphiQL.

## Using

```Shell
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
